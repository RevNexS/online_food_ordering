This timepate folder is intended for keeping design files.
Only hmtl, css, imges. extra before its implemented in django. 

Files from here will be picked up and then taken to /web/templates.
And Django template language will be used inside this html file to
make a functioning app.

Do not get confuse between this two directories.

tldr;
/templates          : for design
/web/templates      : for django templates
